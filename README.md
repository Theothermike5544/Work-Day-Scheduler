# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Challenge Assessment
This assessment allowed me the opportunity to create a working scheduler utilizing some previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, while implementing Jquery, Bootstrap, and Moment API use. JQuery was utilized in the Script file to greatly shorten my JavaScript code to dynamically create a working application utilizing a base structure format in my Index.HTML. Bootstrap allowed me to apply specific grid-blocking and styling elements to that base HTML structure on the Index.html page. And moment.js was only really used for displaying the date / time / day displays and formatting.


## Use Case
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  </br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  </br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively  </br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule  </br>
WHEN I open the planner  </br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar  </br>
WHEN I scroll down  </br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours  </br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day  </br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future  </br>
WHEN I click into a time block  </br>
THEN I can enter an event  </br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block  </br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage  </br>
WHEN I refresh the page  </br>
THEN the saved events persist  </br>
